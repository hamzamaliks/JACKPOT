# JACKPOT
Title: 
The Jackpot
Introduction: 
Jackpot is a widely popular and well-respected turn-based centuries-old casino game. It trains one to use all the resources to the maximum extent. Learning basic casino’s game rules will help you build a strong foundation in Jackpot. The art of the game is not easy to master, though, so many software products have been developed to implement Jackpot as a video game on numerous platforms and assist the beginner, amateur, and professional Jackpot players alike.
Problem Statement: 
The Jackpot game provides a predictable long-term advantage to the casino, or "house", while offering the players the possibility of a short-term gain that in some cases can be large. Some jackpot games have a skill element, where the players' decisions have an impact on the results. Moreover, the Jackpot games helps create an employment and entertainment. It boosts property values and recreational activities.
Methodology: 
This project uses the Python programming language to implement the Jackpot game. With the help of data structures properties of this language, we have applied theoretical knowledge to solve the tactics used in the Jackpot game and how the player comes up with an efficient move. These practical problems improve the manipulative ability. Details of the problem and decomposing things into various objects to solve through the development of the jackpot game is observed. Python programming language is used to design and implement Linked List classes along with its member functions, and constructors. 
The Jackpot game includes several functions. One of them includes which commands the player to start the casino game and wants to bet according to the game balance. Then another function will generate random 7 elements. Moreover, there will be a function to display the score of the player and compare the competitions. Consequently, there will a sequential function to call all the previous functions. The jackpot game will be implemented using the “Linked List” data structure to hold data in individual objects as nodes as it pushes every random value into a node and whenever the user wants to re do one of the random spin the node is deleted and the other node is inserted at that position. Moreover, they are used for efficient insertion and deletion
Conclusion 
Our ‘Data Structurers and Algorithms’ semester project on “The Jackpot” game is implemented in Python language. Our mission is to create a user-friendly jackpot game as this will provide the user an opportunity to double the chance of winning the game. So, if a user loses in first attempt, he will get the chance of winning that bet again by the re-do option. This type of jackpot game is never invented before so producing this game in casinos will make people love playing this game
